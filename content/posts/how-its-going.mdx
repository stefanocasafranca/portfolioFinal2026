Hello! My name is Stefano Casafranca, and I'm a UX Designer and Researcher learning to code. I'm passionate about creating user-centered digital experiences and currently expanding my skills in web development. My background in UX design has given me a strong foundation in understanding user needs and creating intuitive interfaces.

I'm currently learning modern web technologies including Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to bring my design ideas to life. I believe in the power of combining strong design principles with clean, efficient code to create meaningful digital experiences.

My journey in technology and design has been driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real user problems. I'm excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to projects that make a difference in people's digital lives.
